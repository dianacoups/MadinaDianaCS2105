Project name: Online Banking (Kaspi.kz prototype)
Description - We wanted to create a program that helps bank users to monitor bank accounts. The idea was inspired by Kaspi.kz. 

Account class is the base class for all account types to store all the child class object in a single container.
SavingAccount class is an account for Yearly Interest Rate for profit
Checking account class is an account for Transaction Fee
Menu class provides Menu driven User Interaction. User can create and select an account, deposit, withdraw Funds. 

P.S. 
1. We faced a number of difficulties. We couldn't synchronize IntelliJ IDEA with GitHub repository on both computers.
2. We wrote a code only during face-to-face meetings since program was not synchronized on both devices.
3. Third contributor "rencheol" was an old account with forgotten password.
